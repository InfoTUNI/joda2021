{"text": "Everything but the actual cell service worked on the phone I received. This makes the cell phone not function as a phone. I am very surprised that this was not tested before hand. I have taken it to Verizon and Apple. Both told me I was basically out of luck. The seller needs to take the time for QA and QC measures. Poor business model.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars"},
{"text": "Got the phone in the mail, spent half hour trying to switch to this phone gave up and called technical support for verizon.  After almost 2 hours and trying at least a dozen different things I had to get transferred to apple.  Apple then tells me I bought a phone that cant have service on it due to a \"recall\" so we have to send the phone to apple who will have it for up to 6 weeks to repair it.I bought an expensive paperweight at this time...I thought about sending it back, but my daughter really wants it so to apple for repairs it goes.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars"},

They tell you the item is refurbished but they\u2019d be better served saying we paid some college student $50 hit factory reset and then sold it to you for $200.When I got the product there was scoring on the back of the phone (which is expected of a used product, that\u2019s fair), but the speaker is muffled. What\u2019s the point of buying a phone you can hardly talk on. That should have been caught in the so called refurbishing process.", "rating": "1.0 out of 5 stars"},
{"text": "The matte black iPhone 7 that I received is in perfect functional and cosmetic condition. At $150 for the 32GB, I saved $200 over what Verizon was charging for a new unit. The only downside is that the battery is at 81% compared to new, so I'll have to spend $50 to have the battery replaced about a year from now -- but that was expected and not a big deal. I estimated that I had a 25% chance of getting something unacceptable, but my experience with this Amazon Renewed product is excellent.", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars"},
